# React-and-Respond

CS554 Spring'22 Final Project.

- About: This project is a web application that allows users to create and share courses. We adopted a more hands-on approach for the courses in this project allowing the user to read and interact with the course items using a variety of images, videos, hyperlinks and modules like code editor directly into the course.\*
  **How to run this:**

* Make sure you have node installed on your maching.
* Navigate to `hashbing` folder and run `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` for installing the npm packages. This was because one of the libraries used an older version of React.
* Run `npm run dev` to start the front end application.
* Change directory to hashbing-server and run `npm i` to install the node packages.
* Run `npm run seed` to seed the database with the sample data.

* Run `npm run start` to start the server (Make sure you have nodemon installed properly if on Windows) https://dev.to/gabbyj/install-nodemon-and-how-to-deal-with-potential-issues-2og1.
* ðŸš€ Now you're ready to start the application.
